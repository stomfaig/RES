- come up with a way to unify instructions like 'inc', 'inx', 'iny'. The complication here is that some refer to memory addresses and some refer to registers.
    - implement this in their tests too.
- introduce new memory, and related tests.
    + rewrite all memory related methods (mem_read, mem_write, etc) so that they interface with the bus.
+ correct returned address in test addressing helper method.
- addressing_mode_tester
    - rename
    - randomly generate the random addresses
- finish up tests in the CPU module
